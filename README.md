# mcve-rancher-proxying

Reproduction repo for https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/6358.

Steps to reproduce the issue:

1. Clone the reproduction repo: https://github.com/hdodov/mcve-rancher-proxying
2. Run `npm i` to install Node modules (Webpack)
3. Make sure Rancher is running
4. Run `npm run dev`, which starts Rancher and Webpack
5. You should have Rancher running on http://localhost:8000 and Browsersync on http://localhost:9000
6. You'd be able to open http://localhost:8000 and see the regular NGINX page, but http://localhost:9000 (which proxies the former URL) will never open
